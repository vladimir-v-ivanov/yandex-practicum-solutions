# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains my solutions for the Algorithms and Data Structures Yandex Practicum course implemented in C++20.  
Tasks are grouped by **sprints**. Each sprint includes 12–16 problems of increasing complexity, plus final problems.  
 
Each file includes a short description of the task and time and space complexity analysis.

## Repository Structure

- [Sprint 1](./sprint1/README.md) — Basic algorithms and math  
- [Sprint 2](./sprint2/README.md) — Strings and data structures  
- Sprint 3 — Hash tables and sets (WIP)  
- Sprint 4 — Trees and recursion (WIP)  
- Sprint 5 — Graphs (WIP)  
- Sprint 6 — Dynamic programming (WIP)
